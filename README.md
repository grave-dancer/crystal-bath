Video Steganography for high compressed video files in C++ using DCT and Pixel Value Differencing

I'm in the process of refactoring this in C++ since there is a lack of support for C#/Delphi for Linux/BSD, 
(and those are primarily Windows Languages)

I also need to make it more "user friendly".

Requires ffmpeg to be in the same directory as the executable.
The video input format has to be in raw YUV.

Once video steganography is performed, you can re-convert the video to a secondary format MPEG-4, H.264/265, WebM
